# Interview-Questions


Advance Financial with Gene Howell // from Jon Young on 9.10.25

He did not do any whiteboard problem solving. 
He asked me about my background and gave me feedback/tips on how to tie my background into my passion for programming. 
He looks more for whether or not the candidate would be a good culture fit — our programming skills are all generally the same at this point, 
BUT he mentioned how he noticed that NSS is producing students who are way ahead of college grads (woo!). Hopefully that’s some insight.
-- talk about how awesome you are by tying your history into programming
-- believe that you’re actually qualified skill-wise

My interview with Aaron was very laidback and just a general conversation.  
We spoke about my frontend capstone and a little about the fullstack capstone.  
Talked about technologies used, any hurdles that I ran into, etc.  

There were no direct questions about code or how things work, although I did speak about things like:  
- Utilizing `useContext`  
- Setting up a Python/Django project from scratch  
- Learning SQL and transitioning into using an ORM instead  

Aaron said that if this were a technical interview, the way he handles them is in a similar fashion â€” conversation based.  
Simple things (dependent on the technologies you're interviewing for) like:  

- Iterating over arrays  
- Using `.map` in React  
- Handling app state  

The one thing he said he consistently notices in NSS students that we could all improve on is giving a semi sales-pitch on what NSS is  
and why it's so effective and held in high-esteem in the tech community.  

He personally knows about NSS,  
but if we're interviewing with anyone who doesn't know the ins and outs of how NSS functions,  
it would be beneficial to give them a general rundown of how it works and how intensive it is.

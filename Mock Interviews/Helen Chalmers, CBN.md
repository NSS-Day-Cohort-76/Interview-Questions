- Code, code, code. Keep doing projects, and getting that experience in.
- Employers mostly don't care about what you know, but that you can learn — they want to see that you are ready
- If you don't know something, you should probably just say you don't know
- Dominate the conversation - if they give you an opportunity to talk about your capstone, talk as long as you can about it - it gives them less time to hit you with difficult questions
- Look up the basic concepts of whatever is listed on your resume
- "if it's listed on your resume, it's fair game to talk about"
- Prepare some stories to have in your back pocket and rehearse them like:
your backstory, what led you into programming
A time you experienced conflict within a team
etc, etc

# Siddhartha Dhar Choundhury, Amazon Mock Interview (Brit's version) [9/10/25]

### Interview Questions:

```
Tell me about yourself

How was your time in the program? 

What were some of your biggest challenges in the program?

How did you get into coding since you have a background in design?

What game engine did you use, what languages did you use?

On your resume, I see you TA'd a class, what was that experience like/what did you go over?

Tell me about your front end capstone?

Tell me about your full stack capstone and what challenges you faced during it?

Why did you use Python/Django with Next JS?
```


### Coding exercise:
```
In any coding language, how would you write an algorithm to check if a value palindrome and return true(if it is a palindrome) or false(if it is not)? It could be a number or a string
```
- he said that Amazon loves the palindrome question
- he also stressed that this is a thinking question, not a coding question (though at the end he asked how I would write the code)

- He suggested making comments in code during interviews to keep track of logic and also show thought process


### Questions for Interviewer:
```
Do you have any advice for a junior dev, and how to set yourself apart in highly saturated market?
```

He said to keep making projects that you or others use because when people use projects it shows needs you haven't thought of, which transfers to user/customer experiences and employers' number one concern is customers.

Also, do unique projects you are passionate about to standout, you can learn a lot from making clones of other platforms(instagram, netflix), but it doesn't make you standout.

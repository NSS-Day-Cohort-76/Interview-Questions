# Interview with SWE Siddhartha Dhar Choundhury with Amazon by Brandon Hickman

DISCLAIMER: He was pretty softspoken and has a little bit of an accent, so understanding/hearing him may be challenging.

On 9/10/25 I had my first mock (technical) interview with Siddhartha.

We spent 5-10 minutes doing an introduction.

Then 10-15 minutes of him asking about me about 5 questions like,

    What my capstone project was about and what it used.
    
    What all we learned.

    Naming projects you've used "X" language in and examples.

    What was challenging in "X" project.


Then we moved into the coding part where we spent the remainder of the interview, so expect a 25~ min session.

My question dealt with substrings. The goal was to find the longest substring with all unique characters.

This is the question I had if you want to try yourself,

    s = "ababbaabcbb"
    answer = "abc" / 3

I personally got owned on this because I do not know much about substrings, but now I do as Siddhartha was nice enough to explain it by walking me through it.

Also, the coding challenge is very minimal coding, as you only really have to do it enough to demonstrate as you're talking through it - He didn't care about correct syntax
or anything like that, but some coding is required if he's asking what you mean, so don't let it scare you.

That took up the rest of the time for me, and there was 5 min left on my hour for questions. He unfortunately didn't provide me any direct feedback, but I asked a few questions to see what he'd say.

Question 1:
    What technologies do you recommend to learn or to know well?
        -Java. He said Amazon works a lot with Java.
    
Question 2:
    What advice do you have on how I can network when I live in a remote area?
        -LinkedIn (as expected)
        - forums of the technology/stack you're using. He provided an example of using the Django forums if you got questions, but recommended not to use Reddit.

Question 3:
    How do you get ideas for projects to build?
        -Try to build something you'd use daily.
    
Question 4:
    Any advice on how to boost your portfolio to stand out?
        -Build projects not just for yourself, but for others to use providing a user experience.



Overall it was a chill interview. My nerves calmed down quickly, and I just tried to make jokes and laugh. I probably yapped too much, but it was probably due to being nervous. I was just open and honest about things, so here's to hoping that the next one won't be as terrifying. 

Good luck and happy coding!
